# Covid19 Cases and Vaccinations Project

## Description

### Application:

It shows total cases, total deaths and total_vaccinations. I also added columns in MySQL by using raw data such as DeathPercentage, TotalDeathCount, etc. and filtered some rows from raw data. I created four sheets in tableau by using modified data which was done earlier and made a dashboard from that sheets.

### Technologies which are used :

#### Excel
Excel is an incredibly powerful tool for getting meaning out of vast amounts of data. You put data in your cells and group them in rows and columns. That allows you to add up your data, sort and filter it, put it in tables, and build great-looking charts. L

#### MySQL

MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL – Structured Query Language. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for mySQL however, is for the purpose of a web database.

#### Tableau

Tableau is the fastest growing data visualization and data analytics tool that aims to help people see and understand data. ... In other words, it simply converts raw data into a very easily understandable format. Data analysis is great, as it is a powerful visualization tool in the business intelligence industry.

### Challenges:

Some big data take so much time to import data and sometime incomplete data was imported. Forecasting is not happen because of some incomplete data.
